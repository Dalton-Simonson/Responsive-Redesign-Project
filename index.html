            <h3 id="goal_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">We needed to find a website that had some issues to redesign and improve.
                 In particular focusing on the responsiveness of the improved site. I chose the <a id="city_kitty_link" href="https://city-kitty.com/">site</a> for my cat's vet and you can find my redesign
                 <a id="city_kitty_link" href="https://dalton-simonson.github.io/Responsive-Redesign">here</a>. Below is a picture of the original followed by a breakdown of the design process.</h3>

            <h2 id="procedure_section_label" class="section_text katibeh-section-text">Procedure:</h2>
            <h3 id="procedure_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">The first thing to do before redesigning this site was point out some key usability issues.
                 I encourage you to take a look at the original site and see if any of the issues I outline below stick out to you as well.</h3>
                 <ul id="procedure_list" class="sub_list_text karla-list">
                    <li>The signpost "buttons" are not immediately apparent as clickable</li>
                    <li>The ordering of the items are seeimingly arbitrary (request appointment is sequestered off to the bottom right)</li>
                    <li>Similar items are not grouped together</li>
                    <li>Some of the signpost are not actually clickable but are identical to clickable elements</li>
                    <li>Contrast errors throughout the site</li>
                    <li>Overall slightly cluttered, unclear, and questionable color choices</li>
                  </ul>

            <h2 id="visual_redesign_section_label" class="section_text katibeh-section-text">Visual Redesign:</h2>
            <h3 id="main_redesign_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">So now that I knew what some of the problems are with the site I try and maneuver each time my cat decides to eat
                 a hair tie, I could begin to plan out what would be a good design. Starting off with a little speed sketching/brainstorming design layouts. When I had finished
                 I needed to grab the best elements from each smaller sketch and combine them into a single prototype sketch which I would base my redesign from.</h3>

                <img src="Images/final sketch.png" alt="final sketch" id="final_sketch">
            </div>
            <h3 id="main_redesign_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">After deciding the main style of my layout I needed to think about how my layout should translate to different screen
                sizes. Additionally, at this step I needed to think more about color and UI elements. I did this through taking some time to put together some more detailed sketches for a desktop,
                tablet, and mobile layout.
            </h3>
            <div id="screen_sketches">
                <img src="Images/desktop sketch.png" alt="desktop sketch image" id="desktop_sketch" class="screen_layout_sketches">
                <img src="Images/tablet sketch.png" alt="tablet sketch image" id="tablet_sketch" class="screen_layout_sketches">
                <img src="Images/mobile sketch.png" alt="mobile sketch image" id="mobile_sketch" class="screen_layout_sketches">
            </div>
            <h3 id="annotation_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">These new designs aim to tackle the issues presented above with the original site. The new design clearly shows what is clickable
                 and orders those clickable elements in a sensible configuration. For example, making an appointment is one of the most important actions so it is right at the top in a distinguishing color
                  and right next to hours. The location of hours next to this make appointment button is not out of convenience, but efficiency. Before making an appointment the first thing a client would 
                  need to know is what hours they can make an appointment first. I moved less important links/clickable elements to the bottom of the page in a style that still invites some minor attention after the main elements have been scanned.

            <h2 id="high_fidelity_label" class="section_text katibeh-section-text">High Fidelity Mockups:</h2>
            <h3 id="main_redesign_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">Now that I had the layouts I wanted planned out it was time to make a style guide along with some designs that would be more representative of the final product.
